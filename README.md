# Welcome to your SvelteKit application!

If you're reading this, you've already created a project. Congrats!
This repo contains everything you'll need to get up and running, including the components from your prototyped design.


## Developing

Once you've installed dependencies with `npm install`, start a development server with:

```bash
npm run dev

# you can also start the server and open your app in a new browser tab with:
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

To preview the production build:

```bash
npm run preview
```

## Deployment

> When you're ready to deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
